# Cloudwiry File Storage 

  In this project we tried to build an Cloud storage system where users can store and access their files.<br/>
  We have used python as a backend for this project ( Flask Framework).
  <br/>
  <br/>
# Features<br/>
<br/>
1. User Authentication and Session Management<br/>
 We used mongoDB to store the user credentilas and from there we retrieve the user details whenever<br/>
 they try to login and verify the details if the details are valid then a session will be created to<br/>
 that particular user.<br/><br/>
2. Implementation of blob storage server<br/>
For the file storage we are using the server itself as a database.<br/>
whenever a new user registers then a directory will be created for them and they will be given access to it.<br/><br/>
3. Client Application (Web based) for file upload,download,rename and delete<br/>
